		<p class="">
		   Michael Kors is a world-renowned, award-winning designer of luxury accessories and ready-to-wear. His namesake company, established in 1981, currently produces a range of products under his signature Michael Kors Collection and MICHAEL Michael Kors labels. These products include accessories, footwear, watches, jewelry, men’s and women’s ready-to-wear, eyewear and a full line of fragrance products.<br>

Michael Kors stores are operated, either directly or through licensing partners, in some of the most prestigious cities in the world, including New York, Beverly Hills, Chicago, London, Milan, Paris, Munich, Istanbul, Dubai, Seoul, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Rio de Janeiro.<br><br>

Behind this burgeoning empire stands a singular designer with an innate sense of glamour and an unfailing eye for timeless chic. Michael Kors has won numerous accolades within the fashion industry, been honored for his philanthropy, and earned the respect and affection of millions. Wholly dedicated to a vision of style that is as sophisticated as it is indulgent, as iconic as it is modern, he has created an enduring luxury lifestyle empire with a global reach.<br><br>

Michael Kors has always been involved in philanthropy, fighting hunger for more than 20 years. A longtime supporter of God’s Love We Deliver, he has worked with the New York-based organization to help distribute meals to people with HIV/AIDS, cancer and other serious illnesses. In 2013, he partnered with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to help fight world hunger by designing the 100 Series watch. A portion of the proceeds from his special-edition timepiece helps WFP deliver food to children through its school meals program.

We aim to ensure that the workplace is one where all employees feel they can contribute to their maximum potential to help drive our success, and that our workforce reflects the diversity, experiences and perspectives of the people in the countries where we do business.<br>

We are an equal opportunity employer. Michael Kors prohibits discrimination against any employee or applicant for employment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ethnicity, age, disability, veteran status, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other protected class.<br><br>

At Michael Kors, we proactively celebrate global events and cultures with the aim of building awareness and acceptance amongst our employees.<br><br>

To help drive efforts in this area, the Company has formed a Global Diversity Council, with representation by employees from around the world. As a whole, the Council provides valuable input on diversity and inclusion topics and shares feedback from all of the Company’s operating regions. Our Council members also educate and drive diversity and inclusion initiatives at a local level.
