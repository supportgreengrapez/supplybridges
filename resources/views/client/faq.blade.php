			  <p class="text-muted">*Delivery times are approximate. Saturdays, Sundays and holidays are not considered Business Days.<br>** Orders received at our fulfillment center before 12:00 PM EST should ship that same day; orders received after 12:00 PM EST should ship the next Business Day.<br>***Free standard ground shipping valid on orders of $50.00 or more in the U.S. (after all discounts and promotions are applied). Minimum purchase amount does not include taxes or gift wrapping charges. See table above for shipping details.<br><b>NOTE:</b> All deliveries to Puerto Rico, Guam, APO/FPO and P.O. boxes are shipped via our Standard Ground Shipping method only.  For Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and all APO/FPO and P.O. boxes, please allow additional time for delivery to these destinations. Additionally, for some orders having a high dollar value over a certain threshold, we may require signature for the delivery, which means they may not be eligible for Standard Ground Shipping (however, you will not be charged for the expedited shipping method in this circumstance).</p>
			  <h4>Multiple Shipments </h4>
			  <p class="text-muted">Due to varying item availability, multiple items in a single order may be shipped separately.  If you have chosen an expedited shipping method, each individual shipment may have a separate charge, but the total shipping charges for all shipments should not exceed the applicable flat-rate shipping charge for the entire order. Each shipment will have its own tracking number and can be tracked on the Order Status page under the same order number.</p>
			  <h4>Special Items </h4>
			  <p class="text-muted">Some perfumes and makeup are treated as Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT). The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) requires ground-only shipment of Hazardous Materials due to air shipment restrictions and regulations. Accordingly, these HAZMAT items cannot be shipped to Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam or APO/FPO addresses. <br>Due to regulatory restrictions, we are unable to ship items made of exotic skins to California.
